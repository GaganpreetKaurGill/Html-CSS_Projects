## My process

To ease the process of coding I divided the body section into main and footer. The main consists of all the QR components. I have used the flex on the body section to display the main in the center of the screen. The major padding value is provided to the main section as it ease the process of media queries. The developemet is done keeping in mind of "Mobile-first solution".

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
